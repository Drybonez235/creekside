One of the easiest ways to sabotage a Google Ads campaign is choosing the wrong bidding strategy at launch.

Google gives advertisers several automated options—each optimized for a very specific outcome—but most accounts default to whatever looks “recommended” without understanding the tradeoffs. The result is usually predictable: underspending, volatile performance, or a campaign that never exits learning.

Below is a practical breakdown of the four core Google Ads bidding strategies, how they actually work in the real world, and when you should (and shouldn’t) use each one.

## 1. MAXIMIZE CONVERSIONS: THE DEFAULT FOR MOST LEAD GEN ACCOUNTS

**Best for:** Businesses that want the highest possible volume of leads  
**Worst for:** Accounts with little to no conversion data

Maximize Conversions tells Google one thing: **get me as many conversions as possible for my budget.**

Every conversion action is treated equally. A phone call, form submission, chatbot lead, or click-to-email all carry the same weight unless you’ve explicitly assigned values.

**This strategy works best when:**
* You care about lead volume, not lead type
* You’re running a service-based or local business
* You’re generating **15+ conversions per month** consistently

That 15-conversion threshold matters. In practice, Google’s algorithm needs roughly 30 conversions in a 30-day window to stabilize, but campaigns often begin performing reliably once they cross ~15 per month.

> **Common pitfall:** Advertisers turn this on with low budgets and minimal data, then wonder why Google barely spends. Without enough signals, the system gets conservative—and stalls.

## 2. MAXIMIZE CONVERSION VALUE: WHEN NOT ALL CONVERSIONS ARE EQUAL

**Best for:** E-commerce, revenue-driven funnels, or businesses with accurate value tracking  
**Worst for:** Accounts guessing at conversion values

Maximize Conversion Value shifts the goal from **quantity** to **quality**. Instead of chasing more conversions, Google prioritizes conversions that generate higher value.

**This works exceptionally well when:**
* You track purchase revenue directly
* You assign realistic values to different lead types
* Certain actions are dramatically more valuable than others

**Example Value Setup:**
* **Phone call:** ~$25
* **Lead form:** ~$2
* **Email inquiry from enterprise client:** ~$500

When values are set correctly, Google will aggressively pursue higher-impact actions—even if that means fewer total conversions.

**Tradeoff:** Expect **higher cost per conversion**. Google is optimizing for value, not efficiency. This is why conversion value bidding is typically reserved for e-commerce brands, SaaS with clean revenue attribution, or businesses with strong CRM → Ads integration.

## 3. MAXIMIZE CLICKS: THE UNDERRATED DATA-COLLECTION STRATEGY

**Best for:** Low-budget campaigns or stalled conversion-based accounts  
**Worst for:** Businesses that only care about bottom-line efficiency

Maximize Clicks exists for two very specific scenarios—and outside of those, it’s often misused.

### When Maximize Clicks Makes Sense
1. **Traffic-focused campaigns:** If your goal is purely awareness or volume (content promotion, early-stage funnels), clicks are the correct KPI.
2. **Low-budget or data-starved accounts:** If your budget realistically supports **fewer than ~15 conversions per month**, conversion-based bidding often fails.

In those cases, Maximize Clicks helps drive cheaper CPCs, generate traffic faster, and feed Google the data it needs to learn.

**Practical workflow:**
1. Start with Maximize Clicks
2. Accumulate ~15–30 conversions
3. Switch back to Maximize Conversions

## 4. IMPRESSION SHARE: FOR MARKET DOMINATION, NOT EFFICIENCY

**Best for:** Large budgets, brand defense, or aggressive market capture  
**Worst for:** ROI-focused advertisers

Target Impression Share is simple: **show my ads as often as possible.**

You can control the desired impression share percentage (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%), your maximum CPC cap, and your placement preference (top of page or absolute top).

**Reality check:** This gets expensive fast. The higher the position and share, the higher the CPCs. It’s about visibility and dominance, not cost control.

## HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT GOOGLE ADS BIDDING STRATEGY

Here’s the practical decision framework most advertisers should follow:

| Goal | Recommended Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum lead volume** | Maximize Conversions |
| **Highest revenue/ROI** | Maximize Conversion Value |
| **Traction & Data Collection** | Maximize Clicks (temporarily) |
| **Brand Dominance** | Target Impression Share |

### Key Takeaways
* **Maximize Conversions** is the safest default once you have enough data.
* **Conversion Value** only works when values are accurate—not guesses.
* **Maximize Clicks** is a powerful short-term strategy for learning and traction.
* **Impression Share** is about visibility, not ROI.
