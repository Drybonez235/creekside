Google Ads gives advertisers more campaign options than ever—and that’s both a blessing and a problem.

On paper, each campaign type sounds straightforward. In practice, choosing the wrong one can burn budget fast, hide performance data, and make optimization nearly impossible. I’ve seen plenty of accounts fail not because the offer was bad, but because the campaign type never matched the business model.

This guide breaks down the main Google Ads campaign types, what they’re actually good at, and how we typically recommend using them—especially for service businesses and SMBs.

## SEARCH CAMPAIGNS: THE DEFAULT STARTING POINT (FOR A REASON)

Search campaigns are still the backbone of Google Ads.

They place your ads at the top of Google when someone actively searches for a keyword you’re targeting. That intent is the key difference. You’re not interrupting someone—you’re showing up at the exact moment they’re looking.

### WHY SEARCH CAMPAIGNS WORK SO WELL
* High intent traffic (users are already searching)
* Full control over keywords, match types, bids, and negatives
* Clear attribution and performance signals
* Easy to test offers, landing pages, and messaging

Search campaigns also allow you to **optionally include**:
* **Search Partners** (non-Google sites using Google search)
* **Display Network** placements

That flexibility is important. You can test broader reach without committing your entire budget to lower-intent traffic.

**Our default recommendation:**
If you’re a service business, local business, or B2B company, start with Search. Almost always.

## PERFORMANCE MAX: LESS CONTROL, BROADER REACH

Performance Max (PMax) bundles multiple networks into one campaign:
* Search
* Display
* YouTube
* Gmail
* Discover

It sounds efficient—and sometimes it is—but there’s a tradeoff.

### THE REALITY OF PERFORMANCE MAX
* You **cannot turn off** individual networks
* Reporting is aggregated and opaque
* Google automates targeting, placements, and often ad copy
* Works best when you already have strong conversion data

I think of Performance Max as a less controlled version of Search. It can scale accounts that already perform well, but it’s rarely where I’d start from scratch.

**WHEN PMAX MAKES SENSE**
* Limited time to manage campaigns
* Established conversion tracking
* Ecommerce brands with large catalogs
* Advertisers comfortable giving Google the keys

**WHEN IT DOESN’T**
* New accounts with little data
* Advertisers who want tight control
* Lead gen where quality matters more than volume

## DISPLAY CAMPAIGNS: USE AFTER SEARCH PROVES DEMAND

Display campaigns show your ads across websites, apps, and Google-owned properties. They are lower intent by default, which is why we rarely recommend starting here.

### HOW WE ACTUALLY USE DISPLAY
Display works best when:
1. You’ve already proven keyword demand in Search
2. You’re retargeting previous visitors
3. You want to scale awareness cheaply

A smart approach is to start with Search, then watch performance by network. If Display placements outperform Search Partners or even core Search traffic, that’s when it makes sense to break Display out into its own campaign and allocate budget intentionally.

## SHOPPING CAMPAIGNS: ECOMMERCE ONLY (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Shopping campaigns are strictly for ecommerce brands selling physical products online. They pull directly from your product feed and show product images, prices, brand names, and reviews.

If you don’t sell products directly on your website, **do not use Shopping campaigns.** They’re designed for purchase intent, not lead generation.

---

## VIDEO CAMPAIGNS: ATTENTION IS THE REAL COST

Video campaigns run primarily on YouTube. They can work—but only if the creative is strong.

### WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS FOR YOUTUBE ADS
* A strong hook in the **first 5 seconds**
* Short, direct messaging
* Clear reason not to skip

**Best use cases:**
* Brand awareness
* Promoting an experience or offer
* Retargeting warm audiences

---

## APP CAMPAIGNS: NICHE BUT USEFUL

App campaigns are designed specifically to drive app installs or in-app actions. App campaigns simply streamline the process if installs are your primary goal.

---

## SMART CAMPAIGNS: MOSTLY GOING AWAY (AND THAT’S FINE)

Google has been phasing out Smart campaigns, and for good reason. They offer very limited control and often poor efficiency. For serious advertisers, they’re rarely worth it.

---

## DEMAND GEN: NOT OUR FOCUS

Demand Gen campaigns are newer, visually driven campaigns that overlap with Display and Performance Max placements. We don’t actively use or recommend them for most accounts, especially service-based businesses.

## HOW WE CHOOSE CAMPAIGN TYPES IN PRACTICE

Here’s the simplified decision framework we use:

| Business Goal | Recommended Campaign Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Service businesses** | Start with **Search** |
| **Ecommerce** | Use **Shopping**, then layer in Search or PMax |
| **Video promotion** | Use **Video campaigns** |
| **Limited time/experience** | Consider **Performance Max** |
| **Awareness/Retargeting** | Add **Display** after Search proves demand |

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
* Search campaigns are still the most reliable starting point.
* Performance Max trades control for convenience.
* Display works best after Search proves demand.
* Shopping is ecommerce-only—no exceptions.
* Video success depends almost entirely on creative quality.

Choosing the wrong campaign type won’t just hurt performance—it will make optimization impossible. Start simple, prove intent, then expand.
