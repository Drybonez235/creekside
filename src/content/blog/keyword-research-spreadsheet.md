If you’ve ever launched a new Google Ads campaign and watched the search terms report fill up with junk, you already know the painful truth: **your campaign structure is only as good as your keyword planning.**

Most "keyword research" tutorials stop at: find keywords, add keywords, ship it. That’s how you end up paying for clicks from people who want indoor skydiving when you sell tandem jumps.

## The Workflow Overview
This article walks through a simple, repeatable workflow tracked inside a spreadsheet per ad group. We will use:

* **SEMrush:** To pull competitive keyword data (volume, CPC, difficulty, intent signals).
* **Google Keyword Planner:** To validate local search demand and seasonality.
* **Ad Group Tabs:** A spreadsheet tab per ad group to track decisions "with receipts."

## Step 1: Treat Each Ad Group Like Its Own Project
Here’s the discipline most advertisers skip: **do this workflow for every single ad group.** If you lump "skydiving prices" with "tandem skydiving," you lose control over ad relevance and landing page alignment.

### What to do in the spreadsheet:
1.  Duplicate your research tab for each ad group.
2.  Name tabs by intent (e.g., *Tandem – General*, *Tandem – Near Me*, *Gift Cards*).
3.  This makes troubleshooting later 10x easier.

## Step 2: Start With a "Seed" Keyword (SEMrush)
Instead of brainstorming from scratch, steal a smarter starting point from your competitor's top organic terms.

* In SEMrush, go to **SEO Dashboard → Domain Overview**.
* Paste a competitor domain.
* Pick one strong keyword relevant to the specific ad group you’re building.

## Step 3: Pull Paid Keyword Metrics
Switch to the data that actually matters for Google Ads planning in the **Keyword Magic Tool**.

* **PKD % (Personal Keyword Difficulty):** A proxy for how crowded the market is.
* **CPC Estimate:** A directional cost expectation.
* **Intent Tag:** If SEMrush flags a term as *Commercial* or *Transactional*, it deserves earlier testing.

## Step 4: Build Your Negative List Before Launch
This is the part that separates amateur advertisers from professionals. For a tandem-jump ad group, you want to exclude intent buckets that don't belong, such as:
* Solo training
* License / certification
* Equipment or jobs

> **Pro Tip:** Don't blindly exclude. Spot-check the "solo" cluster to make sure a relevant term like "tandem" didn't accidentally get swept up in the exclusion.

## Step 5: Validate Local Demand (Google Keyword Planner)
SEMrush is directional, but Google owns the actual behavior. Use Keyword Planner to validate localized volume.

* **Target the DMA:** If your service area is a tiny suburb, target the "DMA region" around the nearest major city to get usable trend data.
* **Filter Duplicates:** If two terms show the exact same trend graph, they map to the same intent. You don't need 6 redundant variations in one ad group.

## Step 6: Capture Peaks and Valleys
Keyword Planner’s trend chart helps you plan budget changes proactively.

* **Peak Months:** When demand spikes (Summer for skydiving).
* **Valley Months:** When demand drops (Colder months).
* Recording these ensures you don't panic when "nothing works anymore" during the off-season.

## Step 7: The "Launch-Ready" Selection
Use your spreadsheet to choose starting keywords based on two main columns:
1.  **Avg. Monthly Searches** (Local/Real)
2.  **CPC** (Directional competitiveness)

### Recommended Launch Approach
* Start with a tight set of **5–15 keywords** max.
* Use **Phrase + Exact** match to keep intent clean early.
* Add **Broad match** only once you have strong negatives and a budget to learn.
