Most businesses don’t fail at digital marketing because they pick the wrong channel. They fail because they never had a real strategy to begin with.

What usually happens instead is this:
* Someone runs Google Ads because “that’s what competitors are doing”
* SEO is treated as a vague, long-term hope
* Social media exists, but with no connection to revenue
* Retention, upsells, and lifecycle marketing are afterthoughts

At Creekside Marketing, we ran into this problem constantly—especially when onboarding new clients who knew they needed help but didn’t have the time (or budget) for weeks of discovery.

That’s why we started using a strategy generator that allows us to build a fully comprehensive digital marketing strategy—covering SEO, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, funnel stages, and retention—in minutes, not weeks.

## STEP 1: START WITH THE BUSINESS, NOT THE CHANNELS

The first mistake most marketers make is jumping straight into platforms. Instead, we start with something simple:
1. Brand name or product name
2. Business type

In our example, we used a full-service auto repair shop that we already manage Google Ads for. Here’s the key insight: **You don’t need perfect information.** If you’re an agency, or even a consultant pitching a prospect, you can usually pull everything you need from the homepage, services page, and about page.

## STEP 2: DESCRIBE THE SERVICE (USE THE CLIENT’S OWN LANGUAGE)

Rather than trying to “reword” the business, we pull directly from how they already describe themselves. For a local auto shop, that might include types of vehicles serviced and core repair services (brakes, diagnostics, engine work). 

This keeps the strategy grounded in reality and aligns marketing messaging with what customers already expect. At this stage, accuracy matters more than creativity.

## STEP 3: IDENTIFY KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

This is one of the most important—and most overlooked—steps. We look for specific credibility markers, such as:
* ASC-certified mechanics
* Family-owned and operated
* Years in business
* Local reputation or specialization

These details later influence ad messaging, SEO positioning, and landing page angles. If you skip this step, your marketing will sound generic—no matter how much ad spend you throw at it.

## STEP 4: PRICING MODEL (OPTIONAL)

Not every business has clean, fixed pricing. For service-based businesses like auto repair, HVAC, or legal services, quotes are customized. If pricing is important to the buying decision, include a high-level description; otherwise, leaving it blank won’t hurt the strategy output.

## STEP 5: DEFINE THE TARGET AUDIENCE

The tool allows for up to three distinct personas. This is especially useful if:
* You target residential and commercial customers
* You sell different services to different segments
* You need different messaging across platforms

Each audience influences how SEO, paid ads, and social campaigns are structured downstream.

## STEP 6: GENERATE THE FULL DIGITAL MARKETING STRATEGY

Once entered, the strategy is generated in a few minutes. You get a full-funnel breakdown, including:

### CHANNEL-SPECIFIC STRATEGY
* SEO priorities and content themes
* Google Ads structure and intent targeting
* Facebook and social ad use cases

### FUNNEL MAPPING
* **Top-of-funnel:** Awareness tactics
* **Middle-of-funnel:** Consideration campaigns
* **Bottom-of-funnel:** Conversion strategies

### RETENTION & EXECUTION
* How to reduce customer churn and re-engage past customers
* What to test first and where to focus limited budgets
* How to phase implementation over time

## WHY THIS WORKS FOR SMBs

Executing a full strategy takes time and resources. That’s why we often recommend **piecemealing execution**:
1. Start with high-intent Google Ads
2. Use early wins to fund SEO or remarketing
3. Reinvest profits into additional channels

This approach lowers risk while still moving toward a complete ecosystem.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
* You don’t need deep discovery to create a useful strategy.
* Client websites usually contain enough information to get started.
* Differentiators matter more than platforms.
* Execution should be phased, not forced.

A good strategy doesn’t just tell you what to do—it tells you **what to do first.**
